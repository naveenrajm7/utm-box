<!-- Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! Please note that this repository **only builds and shares VM boxes that are generated automatically** using **unattended OS installation methods**. Requests for OS images that do not support unattended installation will not be considered. -->


## **OS Name**
> Provide the name and version of the operating system you are requesting.   

## **Unattended OS Install Method**
> Describe the method or tool used for unattended installation (e.g., cloud-init, kickstart, preseed, autoyast, etc.). If there is an official cloud image from the distribution (qcow2) , it can be used to produce cloud images for UTM. Check all available builders and install methods in [UTM packer plugin](https://github.com/naveenrajm7/packer-plugin-utm/tree/main/.web-docs)

## **Link to Resources**
> Provide links to official documentation, guides, or resources that explain how to configure unattended installation for the requested OS.

## **Important Notes**
- [ ] OS supports **unattended installation** methods or provides an official cloud image.  
- [ ] Provide sufficient documentation or resources to help automate the build process.
